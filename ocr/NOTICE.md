# Optional local OCR components

The base app does not load these assets unless corner OCR is enabled. Images are processed on-device.

- PaddleOCR.js 0.4.2 and PP-OCRv6-small detection / recognition models: Apache-2.0. https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR
- ONNX Runtime Web 1.26.0: MIT. https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime
- OpenCV.js via @techstark/opencv-js: Apache-2.0. https://github.com/TechStark/opencv-js
- js-yaml: MIT. https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml
- clipper-lib: Boost Software License. https://github.com/junmer/clipper-lib

License texts are included in `ocr/licenses/`. Model and runtime hashes are in `manifest-v1.json`.

To rebuild, install the pinned dependencies with `npm ci`, then run `npm run build:ocr`. The two verified model tar files must already be in `ocr/models-v1/`; alternatively provide a directory containing those files as the final command argument. The build checks their SHA-256 hashes before publishing them.
